Data visualization(s) based on suitable visualization techniques in-
cluding a principal component analysis (PCA).
Touch upon the following subjects, use visualizations when it appears sensible.
Keep in mind the ACCENT principles and Tufte’s guidelines when you visual-
ize the data.
 Are there issues with outliers in the data,
 do the attributes appear to be normal distributed,
 are variables correlated,
 does the primary machine learning modeling aim appear to be feasible
based on your visualizations.
There are three aspects that needs to be described when you carry out the
PCA analysis for the report:
 The amount of variation explained as a function of the number of PCA
components included,
 the principal directions of the considered PCA components (either find a
way to plot them or interpret them in terms of the features),
 the data projected onto the considered principal components.
If your attributes have different scales you should include the step where the
data is standardizes by the standard deviation prior to the PCA analysis.
