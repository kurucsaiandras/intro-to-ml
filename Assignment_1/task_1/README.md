1. A description of your data set.
 Explain what your data is about. I.e. what is the overall problem of
interest?
 Provide a reference to where you obtained the data.
 Summarize previous analysis of the data. (i.e. go through one or two
of the original source papers and read what they did to the data and
summarize their results).
 You will be asked to apply (1) classification and (2) regression on your
data in the next report. For now, we want you to consider how this should
be done. Therefore:
Explain, in the context of your problem of interest, what you hope to
accomplish/learn from the data using these techniques?.
Explain which attribute you wish to predict in the regression based on
which other attributes? Which class label will you predict based on which
other attributes in the classification task?
If you need to transform the data in order to carry out these tasks, explain
roughly how you plan to do this.
One of these tasks (1)–(5) is likely more relevant than the rest and will be
denoted the main machine learning aim in the following. The purpose of
the following questions, which asks you to describe/visualize the data, is to
allow you to reflect on the feasibility of this task.
