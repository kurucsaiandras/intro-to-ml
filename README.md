# intro-to-ml

Responsibilities:

Task 1: A description of your data set
  - Leo
  - Rasmus

Task 2:

Descriptions of attributes and data issues
  - Andris

Summary statistics
  - Rasmus

Task 3:
  - Leo: issues with outliers, are attributes normal distributed
  - Rasmus: correlated variables, machine learning modeling aim appear to be feasible
  - Andris: PCA

Exam problems:
  - Rasmus: 1, 4
  - Leo: 2, 5
  - Andris: 3, 6

Next meetup: Sunday afternoon


Feedback from report 1:
Feedback: This is a very good report with some minor issues.
The introduction and recap of previous work are very good, but remember that references should be at the end of the report.
Very good conclusion from the summary statistics part.
A good description of outliers in the dataset. I miss information on whether you investigated if the statistical outliers are actually outliers or, for example, just a wealthy country.
Very good discussion about data distribution and correlation. The correlation matrix would be even more useful if you provided the value of correlation in each box.
The PCA part is good. I like your analysis of principal directions, and I like that you investigated patterns in the projection onto the first two PCs. I would like to see the projection on different PCs.
The plot quality could be better. Some plots are stretched and hard to read. In Figure 9 it would be great to see the legend of plotted colours. I also wouldn’t use as big margin in your layout it’s given the feeling that everything is squeezed.  
Overall, a great report. Including the comments above would have made it perfect
